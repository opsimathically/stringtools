# stringtools

These tools have been cannibalized from a number of my internal projects and consolidated
here. All functions exported work directly with strings, and are designed to provide some
arbitrary string behavior. While network/url based analysis are based on strings, we decided
to include those types of tools in the nettools library instead whereas this library is strictly
basic string operations.

## Install

```bash
npm install @opsimathically/stringtools
```

## Building from source

This package is intended to be run via npm, but if you'd like to build from source,
clone this repo, enter directory, and run `npm install` for dev dependencies, then run
`npm run build`.
